## Overview

Computational Paleontology is an emerging field. Paleontologists are increasingly turning to a wide array of complex computational analyses to address various research questions and test hypotheses. Until recently, paleontologists have mostly leveraged resources designed for evolutionary biologists, ecologists, geographers, and data scientists to accomplish such analyses. However, R resources are now being developed that cater to paleontological tasks and datasets.

We have assembled this task view to bring together R packages that are specifically geared towards acquiring, cleaning, visualizing, and/or analyzing various kinds of paleontological and paleontology-adjacent data. We use this venue to showcase the wide variety of R packages available across the paleosciences and to provide a brief overview of each package for a broad audience of R users.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the task view maintainers or the maintainers of specific packages. Questions may also be directed to the [palaeoverse google group](https://groups.google.com/g/palaeoverse) or the [paleonet](https://paleonet.org/) mailing list.
